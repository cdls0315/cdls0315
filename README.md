# Christian De Los Santos

**Industrial Engineering Intern** ¬∑ San Antonio, TX  
**M.S. Student in Statistics & Data Science (UTSA ¬∑ CAICC)**

I study how complex manufacturing systems behave and how to make them better. My work blends **systems thinking**, **decision science**, and **data engineering** to deliver practical insights.

## About me

- Currently diving deep into **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** for high-tech manufacturing.
- Building fluency in **Python**, **R**, **SAS**, and **SQL**; applying **machine learning** to real operational problems.
- Passionate about **complexity** and **systems thinking**.

## What I'm working on

- üìä OEE & UPH analytics: data pipelines, validation, and dashboards.  
- üßÆ Statistical inference & experimental design for industrial settings.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Manufacturing systems modeling: flow, WIP, cycle time, and bottlenecks.

## Projects

### Closed Queuing Network Simulation

A discrete-event simulation for analyzing closed queuing networks in manufacturing systems. This tool helps understand:

- **Work-in-Process (WIP)** dynamics with a fixed number of jobs
- **Throughput** and **cycle time** performance
- **Bottleneck identification** through utilization analysis
- **Queue behavior** at different workstations

**Key Features:**
- Event-driven simulation engine
- Configurable routing matrices for complex networks
- Multiple servers per station
- Statistical analysis including warmup periods
- Bottleneck detection and performance metrics

**Usage:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python closed_queuing_network.py
```

**Learn More:**
- See [`closed_queuing_network.py`](closed_queuing_network.py) for implementation details
- See [`SIMULATION_GUIDE.md`](SIMULATION_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive documentation
- Run [`wip_analysis_example.py`](wip_analysis_example.py) for advanced WIP analysis
- Run [`test_queuing_network.py`](test_queuing_network.py) to verify the implementation
